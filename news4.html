                When the temperature starts to heat up, people become more interested in finding ways to 
                properly cool their homes. Air conditioning is often at the top of that list. With an air 
                conditioner, you can control the temperature in your home and adjust it to suit your and your 
                family’s needs. Still, many people wonder what the positives are when it comes to having an 
                air conditioner in the home.Entek considers air conditioning to be one of the best ways to 
                effectively cool your home, but your AC is able to do much more than that. Aside from just 
                cooling your home, air conditioners can provide you and your family with a few important 
                health benefits. The health benefits of air conditioning are numerous, as they can control 
                aspects of the air that can eliminate multiple potential health hazards. They also keep the 
                temperature cool enough to avoid heat-related issues. With an air conditioner, you can enjoy 
                these benefits and more simply by turning it on.Here are a few of the health benefits of air 
                conditioning
            </p>

            <p>
                <h5>Improves Air Quality</h5>
                One of the greatest health benefits of air conditioning is that it can greatly improve 
                the air quality in your home. The air you and your family breathe plays a large role in your 
                overall health, as it can trigger illnesses if it’s not good quality. Many people choose 
                to have air conditioning for their added advantages as much as they want it to cool their 
                homes.
                <br>

                Depending on the unit in your home, an air conditioner can contain a filtration system 
                that cleans the air thoroughly. Things like dust, mold, allergens, and bacteria are all 
                likely to enter your home at some point. As they travel through the air, a quality air 
                conditioner will pull them through the filtration system and out of the air you breathe. 
                This can be helpful for people who suffer from allergies or asthma. Clean air can provide 
                a better quality of life for your household and create a more healthy living environment.
                <br>

                To make sure your air conditioner is filtering out as much harmful material as possible, 
                it’s best to change the filter regularly. Changing or cleaning the filter on a consistent 
                basis—usually once a month—will give your unit the best chance at filtering effectively. 
                Indoor air quality experts can point you in the right direction when it comes to finding an 
                air conditioner that can keep your air quality at a healthy level while also reducing utility 
                costs and improving your overall comfort.

                <h5>Removes Humidity</h5>
                
                Nothing is worse than the thick and sticky feeling that comes with humidity, but did you 
                know that your air conditioner can help with that? One of the many health benefits that 
                come with air conditioning is that it can significantly reduce humidity. People often turn 
                on air conditioning to combat the heat with cool air, but while the unit is cooling the room, 
                it’s also working to get rid of the humidity in your home and help you to avoid health hazards.

                <br>


                When hot air is removed from your home by the air conditioner, it blows over an evaporator 
                coil within the unit. The moisture leaves the air as it condenses, and condensation then 
                flows into a drip pan and drains itself from the unit. With the right system, this should 
                happen effortlessly, but there are a few things you need to do occasionally to maintain its 
                working condition. Drip pans should be changed occasionally to prevent overflowing or potential 
                mold growth within the pan itself. Keeping the drip pan full can allow mold to get into the unit,
                 which will decrease the air quality for your home and contribute to humid conditions.Humidity in 
                 your home can be a problem for a few reasons. Yes, it makes the home uncomfortable, but it also
                  makes your home more appealing to things like mold and bugs. Mold thrives in a hot and wet 
                  environment, which is exactly what it gets in a humid home. When mold begins to grow in your home, 
                  it can cause health issues for your family. Mold infestation can lead to allergy-like symptoms, 
                  such as coughing, watery eyes, and sneezing, but it can also lead to more serious health issues.

                <h5>Protects from Heat-Related Illness</h5>
                If you live in a place that can have high temperatures, you may be subject to heat-related 
                illnesses. A heat-related illness, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion, can happen when 
                your body is unable to properly cool itself on its own. This is more likely to happen to 
                seniors, infants, or people with other health conditions, but it’s definitely not exclusive 
                to those demographics.

                <br>

                As weather patterns change, heat waves are becoming more common in places that aren’t used 
                to having them. Underestimating the heat can make you more prone to experiencing heat-related 
                illnesses. Air conditioning is the best option to combat these types of conditions. It allows you 
                to control the temperature within your home and keep it at a level that maintains comfort and 
                coolness for everyone. As the heat intensifies outside, your family can retreat to a safer
                 environment indoors with a reliable air conditioning system.

                <h5>Air Conditioner Health</h5>
                
                The best way to make sure your family receives the health benefits of air conditioning is 
                by making sure that the unit is healthy itself. A good air conditioning unit will give you 
                years of great use, but just like a car, it requires professional assistance. Having occasional
                 maintenance done on your air conditioning unit will catch small issues before they become 
                 larger as well as prevent issues from occurring. This type of maintenance has many benefits 
                 and is easy to keep up with.

                 <br>

                 With the help of professionals like Entek, you can enroll in a planned maintenance program, 
                 that allows professionals to keep track of your unit’s previous maintenance, equipment, 
                 and warranty information. They’ll also keep track of your maintenance schedule and notify 
                 you when it’s time to have your unit checked out. An efficient and good working air 
                 conditioning unit can provide your family with health benefits for years to come.
